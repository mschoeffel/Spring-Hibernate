## Spring Configuration Class

This time we used a Java class to define the configuration of our Spring beans. So we used the annotation "Configuration" to tell Spring this is a configuration class and the annotation "ComponentScan" to tell Spring where to scan for beans. In our App we then have to use the AnnotationConfigApplicationContext class to read our config and set as parameter our config class.
