## Dependency Injection


The MyApp is pure static and the class needs to be modified to get another object generated.

The HelloSpringApp instead reads the applicationContext.xml and generates the object with the gained information and dependency's. So only the XML-File has to be changed if you want another object to be generated or an dependency changes.
