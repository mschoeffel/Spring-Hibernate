## Spring Boot
Here I'll show an example how to code a simple Spring Boot Application.
Spring Boot makes it very easy to create a full spring project with all needed dependencies. To set up a Spring Boot Project just go to the website www.start.spring.io. There you can configure all your needed packages. Spring Boot also comes with a built in Web Servery so you don't have to take care of any problems with the web configuration. You can simply run the Application class and Spring Boot will handle all the needed stuff like booting up a Webserver building the project etc etc. 
For every topic you'll find a directory that contains all the needed files like the java classes, the properties and the pom file.
